# OKHEX

You know what the web needs? Yet another way to write colors!

I know this idea may come off as a joke, but you know what's the eternal ruler of all color formats? The humble RGB hex.

[OKLCH has been making the rounds](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl) as the best color format to use for the next decades. I think it's great and I want it to succeed! Needs more memeability though to really break through to _everybody_.

So hex! Maybe with some nice prefix character like ^, ðŸ‘Œ, OK or something.

I could be wrong, but I'd bet RGB hex is the most copy pasted color string in history, let's ride that success into the colors of a new sunrise.
